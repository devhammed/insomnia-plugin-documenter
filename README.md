# insomnia-plugin-documenter

Export Insomnia workspace HTML documentation.

## How it Works?

The plugin provides a workspace action labelled `Export HTML Documentation...`,
on click it will ask for the output path
(you only have to type this once for each workspace as the plugin remembers the last output path ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­)
and there is support for `~` paths, e.g. `~/dev/AwesomeProject/docs`,
but if you did not provide one it defaults to your `Desktop` folder with a folder named by your workspace slug
(e.g. `Grant Master` becomes `Grant-Master-API-Docs`).

After exporting, you will see a success message that contains path to the
generated docs folder and it is ready to be deployed anywhere that support static HTML hosting
(e.g. GitHub Pages, Vercel, and Netlify).
